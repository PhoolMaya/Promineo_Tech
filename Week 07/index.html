        <h1>Javascript</h1>
        <h3>Let, Var and Const</h3>
        <h4>Let</h4>
        <p>Variables declared with let are block scoped.
            They are accessible only within the block ie. inside loop or conditional statement, where they are defined. Let variable cannot be re-declared 
            within the same scope but can be updated.
        </p>
        <h4>Var</h4> 
         <P>Variables declared with var are globally scoped or function scoped.
            That means if var is declared outside function,it is available for use throughout the entire window and if declared within a function, it's accessible only within that function.
           Var can be re-declared and updated within their scope.
         </P>
         <h4>Const</h4>
         <p>Const is similar to let in terms of block scope. However, variables declared with const must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be updated or re-declared.</p>

         <h3>Promise</h3>
         <p> A promise is an object representing an asynchronous operation. It provides a way to handle the eventual success or failure of that operation.
         When you call an API that returns a promise, the function immediately returns a promise object. This object will eventually provide the result of the operation, whether it succeeds or fails.
        To work with promises, you use a special syntax that makes writing asynchronous instructions more organized and promises allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together.
        In summary, they are a powerful tool for writing clean and efficient JavaScript!
