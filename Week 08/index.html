        <h1>Object- Oriented Programming </h1>
        The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:
<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<p> Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential 
    features or functionalities of an object or module to the user.Abstraction helps improve code maintainability by focusing on essential features and hiding unnecessary details.</p>
<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
<p>Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit or class. 
The goal is to hide the internal details of an object and expose only the necessary information to the outside world. Encapsulation helps maintain code integrity by controlling access to internal details and promoting a clear separation between public and private components.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful concept that allows a subclass class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing you to reuse properties and methods from existing classes when creating new ones.</p>
<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
<p>Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows different objects to respond to the same method or property in different ways. It enables flexibility and extensibility by allowing objects to share behaviors while also allowing specific behaviors to be overridden.

<h2>Extend Keyword</h2>
<p>The extends keyword in JavaScript is used to create a sub class that inherits from another class(parent class).</p>
